<!-- 
base index.html
To run squareEngine you need make a "game" javascript file at the bottom of this html file.
You can call it what ever you want as long as you rename it down there.

Besides having to load squareEngine.js you must have a canvas element with id="squareEngineCanvas"
Also good to have a <p> with id="logger"which gameGrid uses to print output.
