				<h2>API</h2>
				<div id="aboutLogo">

				</div>
				<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/SquareEngine/source">Square engine </a>is available online at Github. <br>
					If you have question setting up a game please check the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> page. <br>

				</p>

				<h2>The 2 main classes</h2>
				<img src="../images/api0.PNG" alt="" width="300">
				<p>
					The gameGrid class is the actual game engine itself. <br>
					It creates and maintains the gameObjects, input events and canvas methods. <br>
					The gameGrid tick() methods is called 60 times a second. <br>
					The tick will then call the appropriate methods depending on its game state. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The states are: START, UPDATE, PAUSED and GAMEOVER. <br>
					The STARTS state will just render the start screen and wait for input. <br>
					The UPDATE is the running game and it will update all its game objects an drender them. <br>
					The PAUSED state skips gameObject updates but calls the render method. <br>
					The GAMEOVER stops all updates.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gameObject is just a simple square that can be created by the gameGrid. <br>
					You can change it's position, size, color, speed and many other attributes. <br>
					You must override a few gameObject methods to get it to do stuff. <br>
					The update() method is called 60 times per frame and it's mostly used to define behavior. <br>
				</p>

				<h2>Extended gameObjects</h2>
				<img src="../images/api1.PNG" alt="" width="500">
				<p>
					Besides the basic gameObject, the library comes with 3 extended gameObjects. <br>
					gameObjectMove is just a simple gameObject but be default it takes keyboard inputs to move. <br>
					gameObjectPaddle is a gameObjectMove but with screen limits. <br>
					gameObjectBall is a gameObject that keeps moving and bounces against the screen edges. <br>
					These 3 classes are odeal to make simple games. <br>
				</p>
				<h2>Other classes</h2>
				<img src="../images/api2.PNG" alt="" width="400">
				<p>
					The library also comes with a few convenience classes:  <br>
					2D Vector class with methods to do vector math. <br>
					A boundingBox class to help with collision detection. <br>
					A square class that extends boundingBox and adds rendering and color methods. <br>
					An RGB color class to help set gameObject colors. <br>
